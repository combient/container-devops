#How Containers are Disrupting Devops
DevOps is implemented through continuous delivery software pipeline. Continuous delivery encompasses continuous development, integration and deployment. With the rapid adoption of containers we asked ourselves,
“How do containers redefine DevOps?”


##Containers Make Environments Consistent
Containers provide a common set of building blocks that can be reused in any stage of development to recreate identical environments for development, testing, staging, and production. Containers extend the idea of write once; deploy anywhere, to an infrastructure abstraction that application developers can easily consume and operations professionals can predictably manage.

##Containers Make Tooling Consistent
Containers provide a disposable, reusable unit that can execute a segment of a delivery pipeline. Critical code quality, analysis, build, and test functions can be consistently reused within developer workspaces, continuous integration systems, and release management tools. Service injection into containers allows developers to code more productively and tooling vendors to provide value throughout the pipeline.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

##Code & Image Lifecycle with Containers
Containers defined by recipes allow developers to edit, version and commit changes in the same way they do code leading to a similar (and sometimes dependent) image lifecycle.
###The Code Lifecycle
####1) Clone
####2) Edit
####3) Analyze
####4) Build
####5) Package (artifacts and source injected)
####6) Run
####7) Debug
####8) Commit
####9) Push

###The Image Lifecycle
####1) Clone
####2) Edit
####3) Build (dependency)
####4) Label
####5) Push
